            <div><h2>My Expirience in Kaggle Titanic ML competition <i class="fas fa-medal"></i> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> and How did I improve on my score </h2>
            <p>The <strong> Titanic challenge</strong> hosted by Kaggle is a competition in which the goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            In this competition, I will be given access to  two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.

            Initally I had a score of 0.77511 which was done without doing any pre-processing on the data and just by applying the RandomForest Model.Then I did some pre-processing like removing outliers and Eleminating the null values and some Dimention reduction.By doing so the score was improved a little and the score jumped to 0.77751 which is not a big leap but the score improved.Let me share with you what I did to improve my score little

            <h2> Exploratory data analysis</h2>
            <p class="mt-3 mb-3">As in different data projects, we'll first start diving into the data and build up our first intuitions.

                In this section, we'll be doing four things.
            <ul>
                <li>Data extraction: Just the usual thing of reading the data from the input (train.csv,test.csv)</li>
                <li>Data Cleaning: This part is one of the part which I did to improve my score</li>
                <li>Plotting:Analysing the data from the graphs</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                <u><h2>Data Cleaning</h2></u>
                <p>For this I just analyzed the data of test and train  using the below command and found  list of attributes from the train dataset like cabin, age and Embarked has lots of null values.The Test Dataset also had null values in cabin and Age and a single null value in Fare.The first and the foremost job is to remove the inconsitancies in order to give accurate predictions of the output</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mt-3 mb-3">
                        <u><h4>Removing inconsitancies-Cabin</h4></u>
                        <p>The Below function TransfromCabin which takes a dataset as an argument generates a new column called "Cabin Info Available" which consits of values "yes" or "No".If the cabin column is null then the column "Cabin Info Available" will be "No".Otherwise it will have a value of "Yes".By doing so we will have a clear idea whether an information on cabin is available or not.After doing this we can actually drop the column "Cabin" from the train datasest.</p>

                        <p>The next attribute which has inconsistancy is the "Embarked" column and the inconsistancy in this column can be removed by replacing the null values with the most frequent values that is the mode of the attribute "Embarked".By doing so the null values in the attribute Embarked would be removed in the train dataset.Filling the null values with the mode of "Embarked" is done as below</p>

                        <u><h4>Removing inconsitancies-Fare</h4></u>
                        <p>As far as fare is concerned there is no null values but some values of Fare are 0.Leaving them as such will not give an acuurate prediction.So I replced the 0 with "Nan" for both test and train dataset with the help of apply funtion.and I wrote a function TransformFare which takes a dataframe as an argument.This function checks for the null values in the fare which would be present as I replced the 0 with NAN and not only that it also checks under which class the value is null and replaces the null value from that particluar Pclass with the mean fare of that particular Pclass and removes the NaN value.</p>

                        <p>Next comes the Age Attribute. There are many null values in the age for both the test as well as the train dataframe and hence we need to remove the inconsistancies.This can be done easily by filling the null values of the Age attribute with the mean of the Age column.But this methord leads to poor accuracy.So what I did was I wrote a function AgebySex which takes a ataframe as an argument and I checked if the age is null and not only that I aslo checked for the Sex column, if the sex is female will subsitute the null value with the average age of female.If the sex is male then will subsitiute the average age of male passengers with the null value.</p>

                    In the previous part, we flirted with the data and just eleminated the inconsistancies. 

In this part, we'll see how to process and transform these variables in such a way the data becomes manageable by a machine learning algorithm.

Then we will ad some more additional features that will be useful in building the model.

Then we can mould the features like the passenger names,Cabin,Ticket informations,Family information and integrate this information in our model.

                            From the name attribute we cam analyze different things such as title of the person.From the dataset the name is the format "Last Name,Title.FirstName".So one can get the title by splicing the value from the positon of the "," to the positon of the ".".By doing so a new column title could be formed.But the problem in the titles is that there are several titles so what I thougth to group similar groups under a common name like 'Don', 'Mme', 'Ms', 'Lady', 'Sir' under a common title 'highness'.Similarly did for other titles too and removed the attribute name which is no longer needed

                        As said above all the members in the Very big family belongs to PClass 3 which is best illustared by the graph below.Thus they have a nearly 0 survival rate.They might have got an loterry and have got the 3 rd class tickets for free.

                        From the above graph it is seen that the the usrvival rate for the male is very very less compared to the females.May be the females and children were given more priorty in place in the saftey boat.This might be the reaon
